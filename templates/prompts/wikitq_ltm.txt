Given the table schema and three example rows out of the table, write a SQLite program to extract the sub-table that contains the information needed to answer the questions.
The SQLite does not need to directly answer the question.
Assume you always have enough information when executing the SQLite.
If you cannot generate the SQLite with high confidence that it is correct, then generate some SQLite that is less complex but correct.
Try to use fuzzy-match for values if you are not sure about the values.
Generate 3 SQLite programs with respect to the question separated by [SQLSEP], the complexities of the SQLite programs generated ascend (basic, intermediate, advanced).
